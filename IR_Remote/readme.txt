This is a combination project I built to test the IRremote library. 

I found most of my information at these three sources: 
http://www.circuitbasics.com/arduino-ir-remote-receiver-tutorial/
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2BstX2ff_g

And the library for the IRremote functionality:

Due to using this custom library, I decided to an an extra challenge of creating my own library to run the 7 segment display piece I used in onethrunine.
