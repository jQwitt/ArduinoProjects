This is a test library I built to learn custom classes for the Arduino IDE.

I based my work on and referenced the tutorials found here: 
http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Library

Additionally, I used the test library written by Nicholas Zambetti as a guideline, found here:  
https://www.arduino.cc/en/hacking/libraries  

As well as the video detailing the keyword syntax here:
