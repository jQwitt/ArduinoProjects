# ArduinoProjects
This is where I keep all the experiments and projects I challenge myself with! 

Everything here is self-taught and directed, with more to come. 
I hope to start tinkering with: 
  - Individually Addressable LED Strips 
  - Motors and Drivers 
  - Sound Detection and Music Synchronization
  - Distance and Object Dectection 
  - Integrated Semi-Permanent Systems on Smaller Microcontrollers
